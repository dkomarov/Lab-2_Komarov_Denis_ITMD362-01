# Switching between virtual desktops on Mac OS X:

# There are multiple ways to switch between virtual desktops or “spaces” on Macintosh OS X. 
# Pressing the “F3” key displays all virtual desktops in a belt across the top of the screen, as well as any open windows.
# From there, it is possible to click and select a desktop to switch to. Pressing “control” + “left or right arrow key” 
# also allows switching between virtual desktops. If on a Mac laptop, such as the MacBook Pro, the trackpad allows 
# customizable hand gestures for switching between desktops. Though it can vary, usually a three finger swipe upwards 
# will view all desktops, then the user chooses and clicks on one as usual, or a three finger swipe left or right will 
# switch between consecutive desktops.
